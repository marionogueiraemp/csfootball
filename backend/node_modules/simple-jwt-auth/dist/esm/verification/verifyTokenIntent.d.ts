/**
 * it is critical to security to check the intent of a token, not just that its well formed.
 *
 * specifically, it is critical to check that:
 * - the token is coming from the intended issuer
 * - the token is intended for your application
 *
 * if either of these things are not satisfied, then the token should not be trusted
 *
 * if either of these things are not verified, then your authentication strategy is vulnerable and could be maliciously abused by an attacker
