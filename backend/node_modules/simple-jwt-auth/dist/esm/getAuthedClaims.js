/**
 * Authenticates the claims made by the JWT, conforming to highest security standards, before returning claims.
 *
 * Checks:
 * - that the token was issued by the expected issuer (prevents trusting malicious issuers)
 * - that the token was issued to be used by the expected audience (prevents trusting tokens issued for a different application to be hijacked used in yours)
 * - that the token is still valid based on timestamps (prevents having tokens that live forever - which are a greater risk if stolen)
 * - that an asymmetric signing algorithm was used (prevents accidental usage of symmetric signing algorithms in distributed setting)
 * - that the issuer really made these claims, by checking the signature (prevents malicious users from manipulating the claims in a token after its been issued)
